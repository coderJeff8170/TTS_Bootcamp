            <h2>Graphic Artist, Illustrator, & aspiring Web Developer.</h2>
            <p>I am a veteran of the United States Air Force and a Graphic Artist with over 20 years'
              experience working in the printing industry.  My vast range of capabilities include photography,
              graphics, logo design, and illustration, and I'm well on my way to include web development on that list.
              I use Photoshop, Illustrator, and traditional media to produce graphics, and ideation and thumbnail
               sketching as a way to help focus customer intent. I have used Dreamweaver as a CMS to
               implement websites. VSCode is my preferred IDE.</p>

            <!-- Description of Studies. -->
            <p class="studies">Graphic arts management skills contemporary to my schooling were geared toward understanding
              the change from process camera with manual stripping to a fully integrated PC based process for
              the modern printshop. Consequently I acquired a strong basic knowledge of printing history
              combined with the fast-paced change characteristic of any industry revolutionized by the
              personal computer. I graduated curious and comfortable with learning new skills.</p>
