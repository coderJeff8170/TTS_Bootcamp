Expectations 11/6:
Expect a document that covers “Basic/Most common uses” for the information that we will cover. This will help you: a) with your coding b) with your memorization of oncoming material. Be sure to give it a firm read over.
Review javascript variables, what happens when scope changes, arrays (notation, use, addressing), objects (notation, use, addressing fields), and all function slides. (50mins - 1.5 hrs).
Complete challenges 2-4 in “Javascript Functions 1". Complete  challenge 1-3 in “Javascript Functions 2”. The way I want you to approach these is in increments of 5 minutes. If you cannot complete one of the sentences of instruction in under 5 minutes, peek at the solution for the proper syntax. Then copy just that portion onto your editor, and break down what is happening in that one line of code. Play around with it, change the inputs, make it break etc, before moving on to the next section of the challenge. If you finish and your code looks different, remember that’s totally okay. (1-1.5hrs)
Complete “Javascript functions homework” on titus. Its 8 total problems in tutorial format. Each one should take about 10~25 minutes. If you have questions about them, and you will, talk to me or your TAs on slack.
Preview SQL slides. This is mandatory. I will be putting out a small SQL exercise I want you to work through prior to Monday’s class.
I am working hard to get spoonfuls of sugar to help this medicine go down smoothly. Thank you all for working so hard on your ends. It gives me a huge amount of motivation when I see you progressing and tearing through this material.
